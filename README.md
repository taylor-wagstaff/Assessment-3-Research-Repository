# Assessment-3-Research-Repository
Taylor's Assessment 3: Research Repository 

# Project Overview

This repo is composed of:
-Coding projects 
-lessons from class, LinkedIn Learning and online
-Reworked code from online, stackoverflow and ChatGpt when absolutely stuck. 
-Learning processing basics

# folder structure
-classlessons: contain lessons from class
-Projects: contains lessons from linkedin learning, reworked code from the internet and personal experiments. 
-websitetest: contains a bookmarks manager using flask, html, css, ptyhon and js.

# The Coding projects I have made are:
-A Bookmark manager(search links, see links, and generate random)
-A web scraper poem generator from headlines on the Economist. 
-Python Turtle drawings. 
-A basic Weather api in terminal (reworked code)
-A random wikipedia image (reworked code)
-a deployed project on render with flask, python, html, css and js(the code for the moving image was reworked from chatgp)
it was going to be the bookmark manager, however, google doesnt let you
view them so instead I just wanted to learn how to deploy using render. 
I mostly use vercel with Nextjs.

# Assessment Overview
For this assignment, you're expected to create a research repository that includes:

-a collection of your own codes
-codes that you've been inspired by or practiced (with comments)
-things that you think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments)

# LO3: Analyse a range of design principles, in relation to coding that is easy to maintain and extend.

# Conditions
It is recommended that you spend between 10 and 12 hours on this assignment. It is better to
add content as you find it, rather than at the end.

All course materials, and any other resources, can be used to complete this assessment.
The work you submit must be your own work. It is an individual assessment.

You can ask your facilitator to clarify the instructions, and/or for advice, but they cannot do or solve the assessment tasks â€“ you must carry out the tasks yourself!
