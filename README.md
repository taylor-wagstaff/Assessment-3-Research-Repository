Taylor's Assessment 3: Research Repository 


# Assessment Overview
For this assignment, you're expected to create a research repository that includes:

a collection of your own codes
codes that you've been inspired by or practiced (with comments)
things that you think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments)

# LO3: Analyse a range of design principles, in relation to coding that is easy to maintain and extend.

# Conditions
It is recommended that you spend between 10 and 12 hours on this assignment. It is better to
add content as you find it, rather than at the end.

All course materials, and any other resources, can be used to complete this assessment.
The work you submit must be your own work. It is an individual assessment.

You can ask your facilitator to clarify the instructions, and/or for advice, but they cannot do or solve the assessment tasks â€“ you must carry out the tasks yourself!
