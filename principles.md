# Single Reponsitibily Principle:

“A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.”

# Open/Closed Principle:

“Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.”

# Liskov Substitution Principle:

"This principle states that objects of a parent’s class should be replaceable with objects of the child’s class without breaking the logic of the application. That requires the objects of your child’s class to behave in the same way as the objects of your parent’s class."

# Interface Segregation Principle:

"Like the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP), the target of the Interface Segregation Principle is to reduce the side effects and frequency of required changes by splitting the code into multiple/independent parts."

# Dependency Inversion Principle:

"Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions."

# Other principles (DRY, KISS, YAGNI)
DRY (Don’t repeat yourself)

This principle states that each small pieces of knowledge (code) may only occur exactly once in the entire system.

KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!)

This principle states that try to keep each small piece of software simple and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

YAGNI (You ain’t gonna need it)

This principle states that always implement things when you actually need them never implements things before you need them.
